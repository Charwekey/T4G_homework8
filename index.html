  <h1>  Summary of Today's Lesson: JavaScript Functions</h1>
  <p>
Today, I explored the fundamentals of JavaScript Functionsâ€”reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks efficiently. Here's what I learned:
<br>
What are Functions?<br>

Functions are reusable code blocks that group statements together to execute a specific task.
<br>
Purpose of JS Functions: <br>

Code Reusability: Write the code once and use it multiple times.
Efficiency: Simplify programs by avoiding repetitive code.
Flexibility: Use different arguments to generate varied outputs.
<br>
Syntax for Creating Functions: <br>

Functions are created using the function keyword, followed by a name, parameters, and the body containing statements.
<br>
Calling a Function: <br>

To execute a function, it must be called, allowing the code within it to run and produce results. <br>
Practical Example: <br>

I learned how to create a function that checks a user's age and provides personalized messages based on their age range, demonstrating how functions can interact with data dynamically.
<br>
Overall, today's lesson emphasized the power and versatility of functions in making code more efficient, reusable, and adaptable
